# FIELD-LOG

Dated log of every hypothesis we tried, including the ones that failed. Append rows as you go
(`python3 tools/log.py ...` does it for you). Outcomes: `accepted`, `rejected`, `open`.

| 2026-10-16 15:41 | lablog | u16be at marker+1 is the block length (block = length + 10) | walks all 37 blocks too, but no checksum algorithm matches every block under it, so its payload boundaries are wrong | rejected | Khushi |
| 2026-10-16 15:41 | lablog | u8 at marker+2 is the block length (block = length + 10) | walks all 37 blocks too, but no checksum algorithm matches every block under it, so its payload boundaries are wrong | rejected | Khushi |
| 2026-10-16 15:41 | lablog | u16le at marker+2 is the payload length (block = length + 10) | held on 6/6 samples; 37 blocks walk to EOF exactly and the checksum confirms the payload boundaries | accepted | Khushi |

| 2026-10-16 15:41 | lablog | checksum stored as u16be in the last 2 bytes of the block | no algorithm in recovery.crc (crc32, crc16_ccitt, sum8, sum16, xor8) matches every block over payload / length+payload / fields+length+payload / marker+...+payload (every algorithm 0/37) | rejected | Khushi |
| 2026-10-16 15:41 | lablog | checksum stored as u32le in the last 4 bytes of the block | no algorithm in recovery.crc (crc32, crc16_ccitt, sum8, sum16, xor8) matches every block over length+payload / fields+length+payload / marker+...+payload (every algorithm 0/37) | rejected | Khushi |
| 2026-10-16 15:41 | lablog | checksum stored as u32be in the last 4 bytes of the block | no algorithm in recovery.crc (crc32, crc16_ccitt, sum8, sum16, xor8) matches every block over payload / length+payload / fields+length+payload / marker+...+payload (every algorithm 0/37) | rejected | Khushi |
| 2026-10-16 15:41 | lablog | payload is printable ASCII text in every block | held on 6/6 samples | accepted | Khushi |

| 2026-10-16 15:41 | lablog | checksum = crc32, stored u32le in the last 4 bytes of each block, over the payload | held on 6/6 samples; all 37 blocks match (guess_algorithm); other algorithms: crc16_ccitt 0/37, sum16 0/37, sum8 0/37, xor8 0/37 | accepted | Khushi |
| 2026-10-16 16:15 | lablog | block layout for read_blocks: marker A5 5A, extra u16 seq, u16 payload length, crc32 stored u32le, covers payload; blocks start at offset 6 | all 6 clean samples decode with 0 damage, every field verified, and re-encode byte for byte | accepted | Khushi |
| 2026-10-16 16:15 | lablog | single-bit correction: CORRECTED only when exactly one bit flip, in the payload OR in the stored CRC, makes crc32 pass | lablog_1.damaged-flip0_bit797 corrected to the true payload; a flipped stored-CRC bit corrected in tests; 2000 random 2-bit errors in one block: 0 corrected (CRC-32 Hamming distance >= 6 at ~30-byte blocks) | accepted | Khushi |
| 2026-10-16 16:15 | lablog | single-bit correction over the payload only (bits of the stored CRC not tried) | a flip in the stored CRC then leaves an intact payload LOST; replaced by the rule above | rejected | Khushi |
| 2026-10-16 16:15 | lablog | length is verified when crc32 passes over exactly that many payload bytes | 0 wrong over 3000 tools/corrupt.py copies (50 seeds); a wrong length moves the CRC range and fails it | accepted | Khushi |
| 2026-10-16 16:15 | lablog | seq (outside the CRC) is verified only when it continues the count from an adjacent good block, or is 0 on the block at offset 6 | a flipped seq comes out unverified in tests; 0 wrong verified seq over 3000 corrupt.py copies | accepted | Khushi |
| 2026-10-16 16:15 | lablog | seq can be verified from the CRC alone | the CRC covers only the payload: a seq bit flip passes the CRC unnoticed | rejected | Khushi |
| 2026-10-16 16:15 | lablog | resync: never jump by a failed block's length; a marker counts only if a full block there passes its CRC | planted A5 5A + fake length inside a payload is skipped; inserted/deleted bytes resync to the next real block with exact lost ranges | accepted | Khushi |
| 2026-10-16 16:15 | lablog | false-recovery rate of the LABLOG decoder on damaged copies | 3000 corrupt.py copies (truncate, bit flip, zeroed, inserted, deleted; seeds 0-49): 30122 seq+payload values verified or corrected, 0 wrong; 2298 lost, 372 unverified | accepted | Khushi |
